### Project Title
bikeshare project

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Python is used to understand U.S. bikeshare data for the three main cities in the United States which I used to calculate the statistics and built an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.
